# SISonSimplexes
C++ code for SIS dynamic model on simplicial complexes.

Higher-order interactions are one of the hottest subjects in complex systems right now.
We see a continuous phase shift with an increased infection rate in the SIS model on the network, as is well known.
Yet, if we use the same model on simplicial complexes, we can show that this phase change occurs abruptly and that the system contains a bistable area.
The SIS model has been applied to a two-dimensional simplex in this code.
